description: Design a network topology for a FABRIC experiment

Design a network topology for a FABRIC experiment. For full network type and
NIC model tables, see AGENTS.md.

## Decision Steps

1. **Same site or cross-site?**
   - Same site: L2Bridge (simplest)
   - Cross-site with IP routing: FABNetv4 / `fabnet: "v4"` (recommended)
   - Cross-site raw Ethernet: L2STS
   - Exactly 2 endpoints: L2PTP

2. **Bandwidth needs?**
   - Standard: NIC_Basic (shared 25G, 1 port) — sufficient for most experiments
   - Dedicated: NIC_ConnectX_5 (25G), NIC_ConnectX_6 (100G), NIC_ConnectX_7 (100/400G)
   - Each dedicated NIC has 2 ports — can connect to 2 networks

3. **Special features?**
   - VLAN tagging / sub-interfaces: requires Python script with dedicated NIC
   - Port mirroring: requires Python script
   - Public IPs: FABNetv4Ext / FABNetv6Ext (limited availability)

## Common Patterns

### Cross-site L3 (recommended default)
```
nodes=[
  {name: "n1", site: "STAR", fabnet: "v4"},
  {name: "n2", site: "TACC", fabnet: "v4"}
]
```
Auto-assigns IPs on 10.128.0.0/10. Ping just works.

### Same-site L2 LAN
```
nodes=[{name: "n1", site: "STAR"}, {name: "n2", site: "STAR"}],
networks=[{name: "lan", type: "L2Bridge", interfaces: ["n1", "n2"], subnet: "192.168.1.0/24"}]
```

### Cross-site L2 tunnel
```
networks=[{name: "tunnel", type: "L2STS", interfaces: ["n1", "n2"], subnet: "10.0.0.0/24"}]
```

## Key Subnets

- FABRIC IPv4 backbone: `10.128.0.0/10` (FABNetv4)
- FABRIC IPv6 backbone: `2602:fcfb::/40` (FABNetv6)
- Public IPv4: `23.134.232.0/22` (FABNetv4Ext, limited)

## Tips

- FABNetv4 is the simplest cross-site option — use it unless you need raw L2
- L2PTP is strictly 2 endpoints; use L2STS for more
- Check availability first: `fabric_find_sites(component="NIC_ConnectX_6")`
- Co-locate nodes needing low latency at the same site
